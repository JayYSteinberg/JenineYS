### ðŸ‘‹  Hi there, Iâ€™m Jay.

Software engineer with a proven ability to deliver robust, effective products in collaborative settings under strict and often tight time constraints. Always seeking personal growth, I started my coding journey through a 1,000+ hour coding Bootcamp focused on fullstack Javascript. Excited to take on a challenge, shortly after graduating my bootcamp I secured a position where I was in charge of building out an internal frontend component library for a small venture capital and private equity company. During this experience I sharpened my software development skills by collaborating with team members through Click Up and Github, providing Figma mock-ups, and writing and completing frontend tests. I am now eagerly searching for an opportunity where I can not only utilize my skill set, but where I can also continue to learn, grow, and expand my horizons.
